<h1>The Best Anime According to Simon </h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Attack on titan</h3>
<p>When it come to realize that Attack on Titan is an anime that could be considered action-adventure, dystopian fiction, war fiction, and mecha, it becomes clear just how brilliant this series is.</p>
<h3>Code Geass</h3>
<p>The story is as grand as anime can get in terms of both scale and nuance, and with such a satisfying conclusion, the series is remembered fondly by many for its complex themes, morally ambiguous characters, and scale of the overall conflict.</p>
<h3>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</h3>
<p>The characters are exceptionally well-developed, each with their own complex motivations and growth arcs.</p>
